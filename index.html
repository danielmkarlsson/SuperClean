The title alludes to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value" target="_blank">Use value</a>. 
I want to explore other methods of distribution and how that affects how my work is perceived. I want to actively 
distance myself and  my artistic output from contemporary pressures to commodify all things. 
I feel at unease as an artist existing within a society which has been completely subdued by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism" target="_blank">Neoliberalism</a>. 
I am increasingly longing to create an alternative means of existing within the system, while striving to increase the 
usefulness of my work to others engaged in struggle. I aim to adress how scarcity is often produced and artificially 
upheld in commerce by creating works that offer the listener abundance at zero cost. I regard giving the music and code 
away as a questioning of how value is attributed to goods or services in general and works of art in particular.

A drone of infinite duration. 
Made with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mzepfzu1uy7o0q9/SuperCollider-OSX-3.7.1.zip?dl=1">SuperCollider 3.7</a> 
Listen to the beginning of it in the player above. 
Click <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j8wqocpdr166s0x/No%20value%20without%20utility.scd?dl=1">here</a> to download 
the .scd file that is the piece. It contains code that can be run forever just to listen to it or you can take it apart 
and mess around with it so you can learn how to make your own Synthdef (which can make sound) and your own Pdef (which 
can make sequencing). 
At the top of the .scd file there is a no previous experience explanation of how to get sound going in SuperCollider 
and also how to get the .scd file running on your machine. 
At the bottom of the file is a practical walkthrough of how to get extensions installed on your machine.
Some previous experience with synthesis in general might come in handy but you'll be ok either way.

<p>The title alludes to a conversation I had with a colleague about the purpose of making music. We discussed what can be 
hoped for in terms of a best case scenario outcome from someone having heard it. To loose one's self to the act of listening. 
To become fully that which is attentively experiencing the music. I've also felt a need to separate myself 
from my work. I want to give my work away and  to free my music from myself. To make it free not only in a strictly monetary 
sense but also to make it's inner workings available and approachable. To open it up. I increasingly want to steer clear 
of any mystery surrounding the mechanical aspects of how my music is produced. What remains should be my choices. 
I am at unease by how entrenched in secrecy the means of production can be. To what avail? This .scd is valuable to me. 
It contains solutions to problems I've encountered producing music. It represents a realization of potential. 
Essentially it turns my dreams into reality. I am attempting to make this .scd valuable to you as well. I hope it 
is of use to you, not only for its sonorous capabilities, but also as a means for you to approach SuperCollider for your 
own ends. It would be wrong for me to not share this code with others. Not sharing would be a disservice to others as 
it would place limits on learning. 
On a fundamental level I feel that the only way I deserve to know anything is to share that knowledge, with everyone. 
Briefly put: I want to enable you to do things. To listen to my music is one of them, to explore making music of your own 
with SuperCollider is another.

Throughout the .scd I've tried to make as few assumptions about previous knowledge of SuperCollider as possible
